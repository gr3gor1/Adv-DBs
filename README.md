# Adv DBs
Advanced Databases Project

This repository contains the code for executing the queries required for the semester project of the Advanced Topics in Databases course. The additional file that appears can be used to create the dataframes and RDDs that we may need. Furthermore, snapshots are provided for some indicative times for executing the queries with one and two workers.
